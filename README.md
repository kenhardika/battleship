Battleship - The Game

In this project I am building another classic game, battleship which is strategy type guessing game for 2 players (human or AI).
Its played on ruled grids so basically you arrange blocks of grid as a ship with different length, ex: 4 straight blocks and put it anywhere on the grid map.
Once after you arranged all of your ships, you're proceed to guess where opponent's ships are by attacking them using grid as the coordinate,
Each attack will destroy one grid and it will count as one move. Each player do it consecutively until the first one who managed to destroy all of the opponent's ships, will win the game

So this is quite tricky, I have to make sure you cannot place the ships right beside another ship. You have to make a space between ships.
The hard part is to make sure the space is available right around the ship.
