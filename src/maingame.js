// in this file we are gonna gather all the components of Battleship The Game and turn it into real game

// player. What does player do.
// player start the game by choosing who youre playing with
// player choose is it gonna be vs AI or vs Human
// at this point, if you choose AI. AI will automatically place their ships randomly on gameboard.
// player choose the ships placement accross the gameboard.
// ship's placement is based on one rule that there is always one empty block between one and another placed ships
// player have a choice to randomly place the ships by clicking the random button. 
// player placement order is.. first you place one big ship (5 in length), then two mid ship (3 in length), then three small ship (2 in length) 
// after all ships are placed, game initiate to start attacking by choosing the opponents's gameboard. This phase you could hit opponents's ship.
// after you attack opponent's ship, game automatically change to opponent's turn. This time Opponent's will initiate attack player's gameboard randomly.
// The AI does not have to be smart, but it should know whether or not a given move is legal. (i.e. it shouldnâ€™t shoot the same coordinate twice). 
// Game repeating the previous step until one of the player/AI ships are fully cleaned (all destroyed)
// game ending if one of the player/AI total healthbar (ships) are = 0.
